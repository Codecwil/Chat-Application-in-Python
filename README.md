# Chat-Application-in-Python
Iâ€™m happy to share this easy Python project that emulates a Walkie-Talkie chat application using sockets. The project consists of two scripts: IT_chat_Server.py and IT_chat_Client.py. These scripts allow communication between a server and a client on the same local host.
